# Project Exam 2
This is my delivery for my "Project exam 2". The goal for the assigment was as follows:

"To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills."

## Description

### Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

### User Stories

The client has specified the following requirements in the form of User Stories:

```
A user may view a list of Venues
A user may search for a specific Venue
A user may view a specific Venue page by id
A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a customer
A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager
A registered Venue manager may create a Venue
A registered Venue manager may update a Venue they manage
A registered Venue manager may delete a Venue they manage
A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
A registered user may login
A registered user may update their avatar
A registered user may logout
```


## Getting started

### Installing

To get project up and running, use the following terminal command(s). 

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:bLangved/project-exam-2.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

To run the app, run the following command(s):

```
npm run dev
```


### API key
Many of the requests done to the API requires the use of an API-key. Information regarding how to create an API-key can be found in the API-docs here: https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/auth/api-key. 

After the API-key is created, store this as a variable in a .env file at the root of the project directory. Since the project is setup with VITE, the default name for the API-key is used, which is "VITE_API_KEY". 
If you feel like changing the handling of the API-key, check the React hooks inside the "hooks"-folder under src at the root of the directory.
